# SearchEngine
Building search engine using python.

It has been build under the UDACITY course cs101 (Intro to computer science).
I learnt Python, a powerful, easy-to-learn, and widely used programming language.
The course also include concepts to know about computer science, 
followed by building a search engine, building it step by step where different modules work in a integrated manner such as crawler, index etc.
